### About Sandya
All of my training and research experience has always been at the intersection of multiple fields. I completed my undergraduate training in 2015 at Johns Hopkins University, where I double majored in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. It was there, in the lab of Professor Sridevi Sarma, that I discovered that I really loved translational research. From there I studied at the University of Cambridge as a Churchill Scholar for one year to earn an M.Phil in Clinical Neurosciences in 2016 (though all of my work was computational). Then I returned to the US to the other Cambridge where I completed my Ph.D. at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology in the lab of Professor Emery Brown. In 2021, I moved across the country to Stanford for my postdoctoral training in the Department of Bioengineering with Professor Todd Coleman and the Division Pain Medicine with Professor Sean Mackey. Now, I'm excited to continue working on translational interdisciplinary solutions at UC Berkeley and UCSF as part of Computational Precision Health!
