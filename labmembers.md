## Graduate Students ##

**Belinda Chen** is a master’s student at UCSF in Health Data Science who recently obtained her B.S. in Chemical Biology and Data Science from UC Berkeley. Passionate about making chronic disease care personalized and accessible, her main research interests include model development for EEG and heart rate capture, medical devices, and medical image segmentation. Outside of research, you can find Belinda spiking volleyballs, playing video games, and exploring coffee shops. 

**Hannah Aguilar** is a UC LEADS Scholar and 4th year masters student majoring in Statistics at UC Berkeley. She is interested in pursuing a career in research merging electronic health record data from wearable devices with genomic data to work on preventing, diagnosing, and treating disease from a personalized medicine lens. In her free time she enjoys running, hosting computational biology workshops, and trying vegetarian-friendly restaurants.

**Bhuvana Ravi Kumar** is a master's student at UC Davis in Computer Science who was in SANDLab for the summer of 2025 through the CITRIS program. She worked on developing graph theoretic frameworks for modeling the autonomic nervous system as a network and neural temporal point process models for heartbeat dynamics. 

We're currently recruiting for the lab! If you are interested in [joining](https://sandyas72.github.io/join/), email Sandya at sandyas AT berkeley DOT edu! If you are a Ph.D. student applying to the CPH, BioE, or Biostat programs, you can list Sandya as faculty you are interested in!


## Undergraduate Students ##

**Abhinav Reddy** is an undergraduate Bioengineering and Business Administration Student in the M.E.T program at UC Berkeley. He is interested in a career of fusing the intersection between mechanical and electrical sensor design with health data collection and automation. Outside of research, he’s an avid rock climber, an experimental chef, and a huge motorsport enthusiast. 

**Ananya Dua** is an undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in Statistics and Mathematics. She is passionate about leveraging advanced modeling and machine learning techniques to address challenges in biomedical and epidemiological settings, with a particular focus on women's health and the potential of wearable technology to improve accessibility and advocacy. Beyond her academic pursuits, she serves as a senior editor at the Berkeley Undergraduate Journal and enjoys unwinding with TLC shows and true-crime podcasts.

**Jeshu Mohan** is an Engineering Physics undergraduate at UC Berkeley. He wants to pursue an MD-PhD with the goal of merging mathematical and computational sciences with medicine. Outside of the lab, Jeshu enjoys cooking many different cuisines, playing soccer, and climbing the global leaderboard of Clash of Clans.

**Ruhi Batchu** is an undergraduate studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. She is currently shadowing the more senior members of the lab in order to learn the technical skills needed for research. Ruhi is interested in pursuing a career in researching computational neuroscience, specifically in epilepsy and autism research. She is also interested in exploring the relationship between the gut, microbiome, and nervous system through computational analysis. In her free time, Ruhi loves to dance, find the best bakeries in town, and go on long walks with her friends. 

**Sajiv Kumar** is an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. He is currently working on signal processing and establishing a data validation pipeline for EEG and EGG data. Sajiv is also investigating Chronic Fatigue and Long Covid and their links to the autonomic nervous system. He is interested in medical applications of computer science, especially when interpreting patient data for disease identification. Outside of the lab, he can be found hiking, playing the Tablas, or listening to music.

**Sriram Gadepalli** is an Integrative Biology major at UC Berkeley, researching Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/Long COVID interactions as well as traumatic brain and spinal injuries. His work involves conducting literature reviews, identifying research gaps, assisting in grant writing and planning to collaborate with patients in clinical applications. Outside of the lab, Sriram enjoys listening to old rock music, swimming in the ocean, and imitating movie characters.

**Wei Wang** is an undergraduate majoring in Bioengineering. In SANDLab, Wei currently primarily works with prototyping sensors and learning more about their electronics. He is interested in the intersection of engineering and neuroscience, including fields such as neuromodulation or brain-machine interfaces. Pursuing a PhD, working in industry as an engineer, or going to medical school are all career choices of interest. As he decides between these options, he is most intent on acquiring applicable engineering skills through varied experiences. Outside of the lab, Wei can be found watching movies, doing a variety of physical activity, or cooking.

**Reuben Koshy Thomas** is an undergraduate majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. After graduating a semester early, he spent the spring of 2025 in SANDLab leading the sensor subgroup development of an integrated multi-sensor platform for at-home physiological monitoring. He brought extensive experience with electronics, PCB design, and neurotechnology to the lab. Now, he has moved to a position in industry in SF.
