The [50-40-90 Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50%E2%80%9340%E2%80%9390_club) is an elite distinction for basketball players who make 50% of field goal attempts, 40% of three point attempts, and 90% of free throw attempts over the course of an NBA season (with a minimum of 300 field goals, 82 three pointers, and 125 free throws made) intended to capture the best players of all time. As a representation of just how exclusive the club is, 50-40-90 seasons have only been accomplished eleven times by seven different players over the course of nearly 40 years since the three point field goal was introduced. 

**Here is some bold text**

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
