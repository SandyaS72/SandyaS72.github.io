Our lab focuses on understanding how the brain interacts with the rest of the body through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). As the body's hidden control system, the ANS is responsible for everything we do not consciously think about, from heartbeats to breathing to digestion to sweating and much more. Because of this, it plays a role in almost every normal and pathological function we have (see the word cloud below for some examples!). It also presents a very rich and understudied testbed to characterize how different parts of the body communicate with each other in health and disease, to track in detail how an individual's body functions, and to explore creative opportunities to intervene for both localized and global effects.
