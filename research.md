Our lab focuses on understanding how the brain interacts with the rest of the body through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). As the body's hidden control system, the ANS is responsible for everything we do not consciously think about, from heartbeats to breathing to digestion to sweating and much more. Because of this, it plays a role in almost every normal and pathological function we have (see the word cloud below for some examples!). It also presents a very rich and understudied testbed to characterize how different parts of the body communicate with each other in health and disease, to track in detail how an individual's body functions, and to explore creative opportunities to intervene for both localized and global effects.

### Our Envisioned Impact Continuum

We believe that monitoring and modeling the ANS can have a huge impact on patient care across a wide array of applications, from shedding light on underlying physiology to providing clinical decision support tools based on an individual's physiology to personalized advance prediction and closed-loop therapeutic delivery algorithms. We aim to work along all points of this continuum. Below are a few examples of the directions we aim to pursue, illustrating the range of applications and impacts.
