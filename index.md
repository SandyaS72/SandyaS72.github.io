<center><h3>Welcome to the Systemic Autonomic Neuro Dynamics (SAND) Lab!</h3></center>  

<center><b>Coming Fall 2024!</b></center>

<h3>About us</h3>

Our team provides a <b>unique interdiciplinary environment</b> bridging computation, engineering, and physiology to understand disease and build precision diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. To do this, we harness the most primitive connection between the brain and the body: <b>the autonomic nervous system</b>.  
  
We are <b>uniquely positioned</b> as dual citizens of two world-class institutions, <b>UC Berkeley and UCSF</b>, as part of the <b>Computational Precision Health</b> division.
